"""CHAPPS Tests

In designing an application like CHAPPS and learning how to test in Python at
the same time, it has been hard to follow a strictly test-driven strategy.
Nevertheless, I have striven to ensure that all features are covered with
tests.

Right now the main deficiency in testing is testing of the install procedure.
That said, there are probably small things here or there which are inadequately
covered.

The tests are only haphazardly documented, and contain some pretty glaring
examples of malignant style inconsistency.  There are some comments, and there
is some amount of documentation.

TODO: clean up style weirdnesses within testing fixtures; provide better
documentation of tests
