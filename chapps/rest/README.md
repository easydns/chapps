## Overview

The bulk of the documentation is generated automatically via FastAPI.

In the examples, square brackets have been used to indicate portions which may or may not occur; in general, **no brackets of any kind** should actually be appearing in any names.

API routes fall under a few different categories:
- user manipulation
- domain manipulation
- quota manipulation
- live quotas
- live sender-domain authorizations
