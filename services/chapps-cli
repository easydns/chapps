    Provided for simplifying entry of large amounts of data at once.  This
    routine is not currently optimized for 1000s of entries, but should be okay
    for 100s.

    This feature runs successive `allow`, `deny` or `set-quota` commands, as
    specified by the first token in the line:

      ['allow', 'deny', 'quota']:<user>:<email,domain, or quota>

    using the next two tokens as the user and the resource in that order, just
    like on the commandline.  In the file, the tokens are separated by colons
    (:) without spaces.  Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.  Lines
    starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored, as are lines under 15 characters
    in length.

    As an example, to allow user `caleb@chapps.io` to send email which appears to
    originate from `chapps.com`, create an entry in the import file like so:

      allow:caleb@chapps.io:chapps.com
      quota:caleb@chapps.io:Q1000

    The second line assigns the quota named `Q1000` to the user `caleb@chapps.io`.

    Pass the filename as an argument to the import_file command.

    Optionally, supply the --create flag to be passed through to allow, in
    order to allow nonexistent resources to be created.
